# Hofman tree

# Priority Queue
## Make heap
Can be achieved by percolating reversely on every element

## Dequeue
Swap between the first element and the last element and decrease the size by 1
Then percolate down from the first element;

## Enqueue
Add the new element to the end of the array, increase the size by 1;
Then up-pop the new element to a suitable place
